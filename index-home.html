                    Thank you for visiting our web site.
                    <br>
                    Our congregation is multiethnic. I believe that God has brought us to Canada and saved
                    us here for a purpose, which is to use us to evangelize our ethnic communities in this
                    city, which will eventually contribute to the spiritual revival of this land. Most of us
                    were born outside of Canada and have a connection with our native lands: our families
                    are there, as are our relatives and friends. We know the language and are familiar with
                    our own people and our culture. These will give us an advantage to reach out to our
                    native lands with the Gospel, facilitating world missions.
                    <br>
                    Regardless of your ethnic and cultural background, you are welcome to our church. You
                    will learn how much God loves you and values you. You will discover a new identity in
                    Jesus Christ. You will meet new friends who will welcome you and eagerly want to
                    fellowship with you in the love of Christ. You will be inspired by a new vision for your
                    life that will enrich you. You will be used by God for His eternal plan. You will
                    participate in God's work which will bear fruit abundantly in your life, bringing Glory
                    to God.
                    <br>
                    God bless you.
                    <br>

                    谢谢你访问我们的网站。
                    我们的聚会是多种族的。我相信是神把我们带到加拿大并在这里拯救了我们为了某种目的，那就是使用我们向在这个城市的不同种族 的人群宣讲福音，这将最后有助于灵魂的重生
                    <br>
                    。我们中大多数人出生在加拿大以外的地方，而且都于各自的祖国有着联系，因为我们的家庭，
                    亲戚和朋友都在那里。我们熟悉我们的母语，我们的人民和文化。这使得我们有优势向我们的祖国传福音，加速福音在世界范围内传播。
                    <br>
                    不管你来自那个种族和文化背景，都欢迎你来到我们的教会。你会明白神是多么的爱你和珍惜你。你会发现在耶稣基督里的你的新身份。
                    你也会遇到新朋友，他们欢迎你而且渴望与你在基督的爱里一起查经。你的生活会受到新的启发，这使你的生活更丰富。神会使用你以 实现他永久的计划。你会参与神的工，这将使你的生命更丰富，荣耀神。
                    <br>
                    愿神祝福你。

                    Windsor Full Gospel Mission Church was founded at the original Patricia Road location in
                    Windsor by a Korean prayer group of about 20 individuals who shared a passion for
                    outreach to lost souls.
                    <br>
                    Because of its proximity to the University of Windsor, Korean student at the university
                    began to attend Sunday services. As these students began to bring their non-Korean
                    friends who were also international students, The Lord revealed the value of
                    international student outreach; once they were saved and trained, these students could
                    carry the Gospel back to their home countries as native missionaries.
                    <br>

                    The first English Sunday service was held with five students; two from mainland China,
                    one from Japan, one from Singapore, and one from East Malaysia.
                    <br>

                    The Lord has blessed the international student ministry. Almost every week new
                    international students (predominantly from mainland China) attend Sunday service. A
                    Friday evening service was initiated for the Mandarin Fellowship, and the Chinese
                    Christian Student Association was officially registered at the University of Windsor. An
                    Internet outreach ministry was also started for the China mission.
                    <br>

                    Because of the growth of the Sunday service congregation, the Sunday English service has
                    been moved to the new location at the Down Mission Center at 664 Victoria Avenue in
                    Windsor. Because of its strategic downtown location, we are now praying for outreach to
                    the ethnic communities in Downtown Windsor.

                    温莎纯福音教会位于温莎Patricia路。其起始于一个大约有20人组成的韩国祷告团，这些人都热心致力于传播福音给那些迷失的人。
                    <br>
                    由于教会靠近温莎大学，那些在学的韩国学生开始参加星期天的崇拜活动。这些学生之后也开始带来非韩国的国际学生朋友,主因此告诉向国际学生传播福音的价值，因为一旦这些学生获得拯救而且受到训练，他/她们会把福音带回到各自的祖国。
                    <br>
                    第一次英文星期天崇拜共有5个学生，其中2个来自中国大陆，1个来自日本，1个来自新加坡，1个来自马来西亚。
                    <br>
                    主祝福我们的国际学生崇拜活动。几乎每周都有新的国际学生(主要是来自中国大陆的)来参加星期天的崇拜。星期五晚上的服侍活动起始于中文普通话查经。中国基督教学生联合会正式在温莎大学注册。一个借助于互联网对中国的福音传播活动已开始。
                    <br>
                    由于星期天崇拜聚会人数的增加，星期天的英语崇拜活动搬到温莎城里的Victoria大街664号。由于城里的优越地理位置，我们在祷告向不同种族的团体传播福音。
