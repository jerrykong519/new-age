                                Thank you for visiting our web site.
                                <br>
                                Our congregation is multiethnic. I believe that God has brought us to Canada and saved
                                us here for a purpose, which is to use us to evangelize our ethnic communities in this
                                city, which will eventually contribute to the spiritual revival of this land. Most of us
                                were born outside of Canada and have a connection with our native lands: our families
                                are there, as are our relatives and friends. We know the language and are familiar with
                                our own people and our culture. These will give us an advantage to reach out to our
                                native lands with the Gospel, facilitating world missions.
                                <br>
                                Regardless of your ethnic and cultural background, you are welcome to our church. You
                                will learn how much God loves you and values you. You will discover a new identity in
                                Jesus Christ. You will meet new friends who will welcome you and eagerly want to
                                fellowship with you in the love of Christ. You will be inspired by a new vision for your
                                life that will enrich you. You will be used by God for His eternal plan. You will
                                participate in God¡¯s work which will bear fruit abundantly in your life, bringing Glory
                                to God.
                                <br>
                                God bless you.
                                <br>

                                Windsor Full Gospel Mission Church was founded at the original Patricia Road location in
                                Windsor by a Korean prayer group of about 20 individuals who shared a passion for
                                outreach to lost souls.
                                <br>
                                Because of its proximity to the University of Windsor, Korean student at the university
                                began to attend Sunday services. As these students began to bring their non-Korean
                                friends who were also international students, The Lord revealed the value of
                                international student outreach; once they were saved and trained, these students could
                                carry the Gospel back to their home countries as native missionaries.
                                <br>

                                The first English Sunday service was held with five students; two from mainland China,
                                one from Japan, one from Singapore, and one from East Malaysia.
                                <br>

                                The Lord has blessed the international student ministry. Almost every week new
                                international students (predominantly from mainland China) attend Sunday service. A
                                Friday evening service was initiated for the Mandarin Fellowship, and the Chinese
                                Christian Student Association was officially registered at the University of Windsor. An
                                Internet outreach ministry was also started for the China mission.
                                <br>

                                Because of the growth of the Sunday service congregation, the Sunday English service has
                                been moved to the new location at the Down Mission Center at 664 Victoria Avenue in
                                Windsor. Because of its strategic downtown location, we are now praying for outreach to
                                the ethnic communities in Downtown Windsor.
